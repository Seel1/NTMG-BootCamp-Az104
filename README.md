## About the Project
This project is designed as part of the Bootcamp AZ-104 to teach the essentials of cloud infrastructure management using IaC on Azure. The repository includes Terraform configurations and scripts to automate and manage resources, following Azure best practices.

### Key Objectives
- **Deploy infrastructure**: Use Terraform, ARM templates, and Bicep for consistent, reliable infrastructure deployments on Azure.
- **Manage CI/CD pipelines for IaC**: Leverage Azure DevOps Pipelines and GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
- **Implement cost management, monitoring, and security controls**: Set up cost alerts, monitor resources, and ensure compliance with Azure policies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Azure Account**: An active Azure subscription is required.
- **Terraform**: [Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) to manage infrastructure as code.
- **Azure CLI**: [Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to interact with Azure from your terminal.
- **GitHub Account**: Required for version control and repository management.
- **Azure DevOps Account**: To set up CI/CD pipelines and manage tasks and work items.

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/bootcamp-az104-iac.git
   ```

## Infrastructure Overview

This project uses Azure resources such as **Virtual Networks**, **Resource Groups**, **Storage Accounts**, and **Virtual Machines**, deployed consistently using **Terraform** and managed through **CI/CD pipelines**. The project is organized into multiple phases and epics:

### Key Phases
1. **Infrastructure Setup and Cost Management**: Configure resource groups, tagging policies, and budget alerts.
2. **GitHub Repository Management**: Create repositories, set up branch protection, repository secrets, and webhooks.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**: Configure multi-stage pipelines in Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions.
4. **Terraform Setup and Configuration**: Install and configure Terraform for local and CI/CD environments.
5. **IaC and Resource Management**: Structure configurations and deploy infrastructure for different environments.
6. **Monitoring and Operations**: Use Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and optional tools like Prometheus.

## Usage

### Deployment Steps
1. **Initialize the Repository**: Ensure the repository is up-to-date and all necessary dependencies are installed.
2. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Run Terraform scripts to deploy resources. CI/CD pipelines automate deployments in Dev, Test, and Prod environments.
3. **Monitor and Manage Costs**: Use tagging and policies for cost tracking. Set up alerts to control spending.
